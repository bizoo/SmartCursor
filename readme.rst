Sublime Text 2 SmartCursor
==========================

See `this <http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2529&start=0>`_ topic for an explication on how it works.

Copy (or create) your own keybindings based on the included Example.sublime-keymap. You can either replace the standard keys like up/down or add new specific keys like alt+up/down.
